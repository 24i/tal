# Contributing

<p class="lead">TAL is licensed under Apache v2.0</p>
TAL is  licensed under a dual licensing approach.
You are welcome to make submissions under the Apache v 2.0 licence.  

We welcome any contributors. There are two ways you might become a contributor:

## Contributing small patches and bug fixes

We want to make contribution of small patches and bug fixes as easy as possible. The
Apache v2.0 licence makes it straight forward to accept such contributions. Clause 5
of Apache v2.0 permits us to include your patches in return for copyright acknowledgement
in the AUTHORS file.

## Contributing new features and improvements

If you want to contribute more than just bug fixes and small patches we ask that you
complete and sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

The purpose of the CLA is to define the terms on which you contribute your work to
TAL and lets us know that everything you contribute is your own. This ensures we can
safely include it under the terms of the Apache Licence, Version 2.0, protecting
the project and anyone who uses it.

The CLA is a licence agreement only; it does not transfer copyright ownership and
does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

### Completing the Contributor Licence Agreement

You can find the CLA [here]({{site.baseurl}}/other/tal_contributor_licence_agreement.pdf).

When completing the CLA, please be very careful to enter all the information
requested, including your email address and Github user name if you have forked
code for us to merge.

The BBC has adapted a dual licensing approach and can make available TAL under a 
separate propietary licence agreement. 
Please contact us for details of these terms.
