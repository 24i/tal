DEPRECATED!

Page strategies now have their own repository:
https://github.com/fmtvp/tal-page-strategies

This directory will be removed in the next major release of TAL.

From now on, page strategies should be imported from the repo above
using your own mechanism, or, preferably, by using TAL as a Node.js
package. Its entry point AntieFramework.js imports the page strategies
repo using the Node.js require() mechanism.

For more details, see the updated documentation:
http://fmtvp.github.io/tal/getting-started/tutorial/createanindex.html
